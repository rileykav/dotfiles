# Initial Setup for Macos


## Homebrew

- It is generally recommended to not use the homebrew installs of python, but to rather use a proper version manager, such as pyenv. To ensure your path is not too littered with whatever installs Homebrew makes, try unlink them: `brew unlink python@3.13` for each version. (Anything wrong with doing this?)
