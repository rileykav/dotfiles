## Bugs and Glithes
- Kindle stretched images can be fixed by using kfx instead of azw3. To install the kfx output in calibre:
    - Preferences > Plugins > Get new plugins > KFX Output
    - This also requires kindle previewer (install via website or homebrew)
    - Sometimes these issues can be fixed by getting a differnt copy of the book, or by messing around with the ebook html code. But I found that kfx is generally better to use.
